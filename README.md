## How to Get This Up and Running?

Follow these foolproof steps:

### 1. Grab the Code
First things first, clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and type:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Inventory-Management-System
```

### 2. Create Your Personal Workspace (Virtual Environment)
Make sure your workspace doesnâ€™t interfere with your global Python setup:

```bash
python -m venv myenv
```

Now, activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Mac/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```

You should see your virtual environment name in your terminal prompt now. Cool, right?

### 3. Load Up the Essentials
Install all the dependencies your app needs:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This step ensures Django and all other necessary libraries are ready to roll.

### 4. Set Up Your Database
Django comes with a built-in SQLite database. Letâ€™s make sure itâ€™s ready:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This command creates all the tables and structures required.

### 5. Fire Up the Server
Run the development server and get your app online locally:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Pop open your browser and type:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

Your Inventory Management System is now live!
